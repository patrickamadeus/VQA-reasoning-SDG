In the image, there are two men playing a game, likely a shooting game, as they are holding guns. One man is positioned on the left side of the image, and the other is on the right side. The guns are located in the hands of the players, with one gun closer to the left side and the other gun closer to the right side. The players are standing on a hill, possibly in a rural area, as suggested by the presence of a house in the background.
