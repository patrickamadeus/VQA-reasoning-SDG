You are an object detection system. Here are step-by-step instructions:
- You are given an image of a game's gameplay
- Based on the image, you need to find the objects in the game
- For each object, you need to find the direction and distance from the player
- If you can't find any object, use NO_ACTION

In the image, 

there are two men playing a game, likely a shooting game, as they are holding guns. One man is positioned on the left side of the image, and the other is on the right side. The guns are located in
 the hands of the players, with one gun closer to the left side and the other gun closer to the right side. The players are standing on a hill, possibly in a rural area, as suggested by the presence of a house 
in the background.
