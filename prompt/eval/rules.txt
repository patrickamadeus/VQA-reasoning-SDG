<<EXAMPLES TO SET YOUR STANDARDS>>
<--1-->
|-> Image ID: 2347921.jpg
|-> Question: How many slices of pizza are on the boy's plate?
|-> Short Answer: 3
|-> Reason: There are three slices of pizza on the boy's plate.

|-- ACCURACY: 3 
(the question is part of the image context, and the short answer satisfy to answer the question)
|-- LOGICAL: 3
(The reason is logical because there are 3 evident slices, that's why the answer is 3)
|-- CLARITY: 3
(It's easy to understand that the underlying reason is the evidence of 3 pieces of pizza)
|-- DETAIL: 1
(Sadly, it lacks detail of reasoning why it can be captured that there are 3 pizzas, better one might elicit the "shape" or the evidence of "pie"-shaped object, etc.)
|-- IRRELEVANCY: 1
(There is no irrelevant detail in the reasoning)
PLAUSIBILITY: 3
(The reason is plausible although lacks detail)


<--2-->
|-> Image ID: 2316548.jpg
|-> Question: Who is responsible for maintaining the train tracks?
|-> Short Answer: Railway company
|-> Reason: The railway company is responsible for maintaining the train tracks to ensure safe and efficient travel for passengers and cargo. Regular inspections and repairs are conducted to prevent accidents and delays.

|-- ACCURACY: 2
(the question only uses partial context [aka there is "who" which clearly there is no information of the railway's ownership in the image], but it still capture partial accuracy by answering "railway company" as it is likely, although assumptive, to be true)
|-- LOGICAL: 2
(The reason is logical because it is common that railway companies mantain their railway system, but since the rubric considers context usage, there is no such information in the image, hence we score 2)
|-- CLARITY: 3
(Pretty clear to understand the reasoning behind choosing "railway company")
|-- DETAIL: 3
(The detail is on point, although one might argue it can be too excessive)
|-- IRRELEVANCY: 3
(Sadly, this is the weak point, too much irrelevancy even from the question respective to the given context on how it assumes there is such "railway company" ownership of the object in the image. Moreover, the reasoning includes too many unnecessary details [inspection, accident, delay], hence 3 is too much irrelevancy)
PLAUSIBILITY: 3
(The reason is plausible irrelevant)
